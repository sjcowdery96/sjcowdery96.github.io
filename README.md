# Koya the Board Game
Assignment for Milestone Project 1 uChicago Bootcamp
This game is a simplified version of Koya

## Basic Gameplay
The goal of koya is to build as many trees as possible. Each tree is worth a point and are built by combining two pairs of symmetric seed pieces around a center. For example in a "+" shape or "x" shape. 

Other shapes can be created by creating two symetric pairs with the same seed at the center. Once this happens a tree is created and the "seed" pieces are converted to roots. 

Desert pieces can be used to block your opponent, but they cannot become roots to trees.

The game continues until each player is out of pieces and the player with the highest score wins! Check the resources below for a full tutorial on the gameplay.
