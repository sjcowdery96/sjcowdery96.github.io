# Koya the Board Game
Assignment for Milestone Project 1 uChicago Bootcamp
This game is a simplified version of Koya

## Basic Gameplay
The goal of koya is to build as many trees as possible. Each tree is worth a point and are built by combining two axes of seed pieces. For example in the "+" shape  or the "x" shape below.

   X       X   X
 X X X       X
   X       X   X

Other possible shapes are below with the same logic of combining two symetric pairs around a center.

X               X     X X        X X
X X X       X X X       X        X 
    X       X           X X    X X 

By creating two symetric pairs with the same center, a tree is created and the "seed" pieces are converted to roots. 

The game continues until each player is out of pieces and the player with the highest score wins!

Desert pieces can be used to block your opponent, but they cannot become roots to trees.
